# Development environment

## Supported foundation

SOVA OSS currently supports CPython 3.11–3.14 on 64-bit Windows, macOS, and
Linux. CI records the concrete GitHub-hosted images used for each commit.

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and clone the repository. No model API
key, SOVA account, TRUSCOR service, Atlas runtime, Docker daemon, or telemetry
opt-in is required for current foundation and contract development.

## Bootstrap

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run sova --version
uv run python -m pytest
```

`uv` creates the project environment and installs exact versions from
`uv.lock`. `.python-version` selects Python 3.11 as the contributor default;
CI also tests later supported versions.

## Quality commands

```bash
uv lock --check
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run python -m pytest --cov=sova --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
uv export --locked --quiet --format requirements.txt --all-groups --no-emit-project --output-file audit-requirements.txt
uv run pip-audit --strict --vulnerability-service osv --requirement audit-requirements.txt --no-deps --disable-pip
uv run python scripts/generate_glossary.py --check
uv run python scripts/generate_taxonomy.py --check
uv run python scripts/check_repository.py
```

The separately pinned hostile-worker mediator has its own Rust lockfile and gate:

```console
cd deploy/worker/network-mediator
rustup toolchain install 1.88.0 --profile minimal --component clippy,rustfmt --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo +1.88.0 fmt --check
cargo +1.88.0 clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo +1.88.0 test --locked
cargo +1.88.0 build --locked --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo +1.88.0 install cargo-audit --locked --version 0.22.2
cargo +1.88.0 audit --deny warnings
```

CI fixes Rust at 1.88.0. Production uses the reviewed Linux musl artifact and its
recorded SHA-256 digest; a developer-host build is not production approval.

Run the confidential/public boundary on Windows:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-public-boundary.ps1
```

Or with PowerShell 7:

```bash
pwsh ./scripts/check-public-boundary.ps1
```

Run everything before requesting review. CI is the authoritative
cross-platform result.

Current Python and Rust audits contain no advisory ignore. Resolved temporary
exceptions and dependencies upgraded after audit findings remain documented in
the [dependency advisory register](../governance/dependency-advisory-register.md).

## Local hooks

```bash
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
git commit -s
```

The hooks use only the locked local environment. They do not fetch independent
hook repositories.

## Build

```bash
uv build
```

The result is a platform-independent SOVA wheel and source distribution under
`dist/`. Runtime installation also resolves the locked JSON Schema validators;
`jsonschema-rs` is distributed as a platform wheel on supported targets. Build
outputs are ignored. The pre-alpha package has not been published to PyPI.

## Platform notes

- Use UTF-8 and LF line endings; `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` control
  repository text.
- Use `Path` instead of string-built paths.
- Tests must not rely on shell-specific behavior unless they are explicitly
  platform-scoped.
- Tests requiring Docker, a model, network, browser, computer control, or Atlas
  must be opt-in and capability-probed when those layers are introduced.
- Never place real credentials in `.env` for tests; use synthetic placeholders
  that cannot authenticate.

## Adding a dependency

Follow [the dependency policy](../governance/dependency-policy.md), then update
`pyproject.toml`, regenerate `uv.lock`, update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and
review every transitive change.
