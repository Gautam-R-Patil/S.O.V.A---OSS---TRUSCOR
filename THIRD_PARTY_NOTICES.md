Transitive Python dependencies and exact versions are recorded in `uv.lock`.
The mediator's complete Rust graph is recorded in its `Cargo.lock`; package
metadata reports Apache-2.0, MIT, Unicode-3.0, or Unlicense licence identifiers,
with dual-licence choices resolved under the applicable permissive option and no
missing licence field. The graph and selected terms must be re-audited on every lockfile change.
GitHub Actions are pinned to
immutable full commit SHAs and are updated through reviewed Dependabot pull requests.

Before adding a runtime dependency, contributor tooling, fixture, copied code,
model, dataset, binary, or action:

1. verify its source, licence, authorship, redistribution terms, and security
   posture;
2. record it here or in the fixture/dataset provenance ledger;
3. regenerate and review `uv.lock`;
4. run the dependency, secret, licence, and public-boundary checks;
5. preserve any required licence or notice text in the distributed artifact.

This ledger is an engineering record, not legal advice. Unclear or incompatible
terms block the dependency until qualified review resolves them.
